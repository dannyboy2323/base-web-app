## Data Flow

User request goes to the Vercel Edge Network (cached), which forwards to
Next.js App Router Server Components. Those fetch from the Sanity Live
Content API via `sanityFetch`, and read the featured story pointer from
Vercel Edge Config via `getFeaturedStorySlug`. Sanity assets are served
from the Sanity CDN. Database queries go through Drizzle ORM to Neon
serverless Postgres via the pooled connection in `db/index.ts`.

## Cache Invalidation

Content changes in Sanity Studio trigger a webhook to `/api/revalidate`
which calls `revalidatePath()` to purge the ISR cache. Content updates
are live within seconds of publishing — no redeploy required.

## Database

Neon Postgres is connected via the Vercel integration. Drizzle ORM provides
type-safe queries generated from the schema in `db/schema.ts`.

- Use `DATABASE_URL` (pooled) for application queries
- Use `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` for migrations and long-running transactions
- Run `npm run db:push` to apply schema changes in development
- Run `npm run db:generate` + `npm run db:migrate` for production migrations
- Neon creates a database branch for each PR preview deployment automatically

## Email

Outgoing email is handled by Resend via `lib/email.ts`. React Email templates
live in `emails/` and are previewed with `npm run email:dev` (opens at localhost:3001).

- Transactional email: use `sendEmail()` from `lib/email.ts`
- Mailing lists and broadcasts: use Resend Broadcasts via the Resend dashboard

## AI

Anthropic Claude is used for automated documentation maintenance via
`scripts/ai-docs-check.mjs`, which runs on every push to `main` through the
`ai-docs.yml` GitHub Actions workflow. Claude reviews the git diff and opens
a PR if any documentation needs updating.
